This project presents a Power BI Dashboard that visualizes and analyzes heart disease data to uncover meaningful insights related to survival rates, age distribution, and risk factors. The dashboard is designed to help medical researchers, analysts, and healthcare professionals make data-driven decisions.
Dashboard Overview:Key Metrics
Survival Rate: 67.89%
Average Age of Survival: 58.76 years
Total Survival Cases: 203
Total Deaths: 96
Visual Insights
Average Count and Average Serum Creatinine by Age Group
Compares serum creatinine levels with survival counts across different age ranges.
Survival Count and Average Ejection Fraction by Age Group
Displays how ejection fraction (a measure of heart pumping efficiency) varies with survival rates.
Survival Rate by Age Group
Highlights which age groups have higher or lower chances of survival.
Impact of Smoking, High Blood Pressure, Anemia, and Diabetes by Age Group
Analyzes the contribution of key risk factors in different age categories.
